_Notion is a **Node.js toolchain manager**, making sure you always get the right version of Node, package managers like npm and Yarn, and CLI tools installed from npm. Best of all, Notion makes tool requirements **declarative and reproducible** by using_ `package.json` _to remember and launch the right versions of a project‚Äôs required tools, so developers and users always see their projects build and run in a consistent environment._

# Minimum viable status update

If you‚Äôre reading this, it‚Äôs probably because one of our contributors reached out to you for early feedback. (Thank you!) Either that, or word spread faster than we expected‚Ä¶ üòù

To get started using Notion, you can install the current snapshot with:

**Mac:**

```shell
$ curl https://github.com/notion-cli/notion/releases/download/v0.1.0/notion-0.1.0-macos.sh -sSLf | bash
```

**Linux:**

```shell
$ curl https://github.com/notion-cli/notion/releases/download/v0.1.0/notion-0.1.0-linux.sh -sSLf | bash
```

Then when you open a new terminal, you should be able to run Notion---you can explore its usage by typing `notion help`.

So here‚Äôs where we are so far: we‚Äôve reached a first milestone that hits enough significant use cases to be able to start dogfooding. It‚Äôs currently working on Linux and Mac (bash only), but we‚Äôve got the structure in place to start adding support for other shells as well as Windows.

We‚Äôre still a ways off from a full release, but this first release demonstrates a few of the things we think are going to make Notion powerful: in particular, a new approach to collaborating on Node projects.

# Project toolchains

The goal of Notion is to enable collaborators on a project to always work with the same version of Node. You can select the Node version for a project with `notion use`:

```shell
$ cd ~/projects/my-app
$ notion use node 10.7
```

This command resolves the Node version, fetches the installer, and pins your project to that version by adding a `"toolchain"` key to your `package.json`:

```json
"toolchain": {
    "node": "10.7.0"
}
```

You can think of this as a declarative way of documenting the version of the Node platform that the project is intended to build and run on.

Now here‚Äôs the cool part: whenever you‚Äôre in a directory inside your project, Notion‚Äôs shims to Node executables (like `node` and `npm`) *automatically* switch to the right versions. For example, if `app1` is pinned to Node 10.7.0, you‚Äôd see this when entering the project directory:

```shell
$ cd ~/projects/app1
$ node --version
v10.7.0
```

And then if `app2` is pinned to, say, Node 8.9.4, you‚Äôd see this instead:

```shell
$ cd ~/projects/app2
$ node --version
v8.9.4
```

In other words, **you never have to think about switching Node setups** as you navigate between projects. And all your project‚Äôs collaborators can use Notion to be sure they‚Äôre always working with the right toolchain for the project. Once you check in the changes to `package.json`, your team will automatically get the right versions of all the relevant tools.

# User toolchains

(First, a caveat: this part of Notion‚Äôs implementation is still pretty basic, and some of the workflows are going to change and improve before Notion 1.0 ships.)

The command for installing user tools is `notion install`. For example, you can choose your version of Node for personal use, which is what you get when you run `node` anywhere *other* than in a pinned project:

```shell
$ notion install node 10
$ cd ~/Desktop # or anywhere that isn't a pinned project
$ node --version
v10.7.0
```

There will eventually be a similar workflow for installing package binaries, and automatic creation of shims in your `PATH` for using them. For now, you need to create these shims yourself with the stopgap command `notion shim`. For example, we can create a shim for the `cowsay` command:

```shell
$ notion shim cowsay
```

Now if you‚Äôre in a project that uses `cowsay` as a dependency, running `cowsay` will automatically use the specified local version, and otherwise it will use the global version. (This command may change or get removed once we start automating the creation of shims.)

What‚Äôs even cooler about Notion shims, in addition to their convenience, is that they **keep your project scripts safely isolated from user tools.** Instead of installing global packages in a shared Node installation, which can make your project builds sensitive to the state of your local machine, Notion follows the best practice of running your project scripts in a Node environment *with no global packages installed*. This gives you the best of both worlds: the convenience of installing tools for personal use that happen to be distributed via Node, but with all the best practices of project maintenance.

# What‚Äôs next?
- **Stateless installation:** This is going to be one of the most important next milestones. At the moment, Notion‚Äôs installations of Node are shared and can drift over time (e.g. by installing global packages). What we plan to do next is to use [libgit2](https://crates.io/crates/git2) to treat a Node installation like an immutable ‚Äúimage,‚Äù making it efficient for every action you do at the command-line through Notion to run as if in its own, freshly-installed Node environment.
- **Windows support, and other shells:** We will ensure that Notion 1.0 ships on Windows as a fully supported platform! We also intend to support popular Unix shells like zsh, fish, and any others that contributors might want to implement.
- **Plugins:** We plan to make Notion extensible, so e.g. your company‚Äôs IT department can configure Notion to provision tools from a private intranet. We‚Äôre also working on enabling companies to collect metrics about usage patterns, outages, etc. (These are all disabled by default for privacy.)
- **CI and offline support:** Continuous integration environments bring some extra requirements, like the ability to choose from a matrix of toolchain options, and the ability to split apart the fetching of remote assets and using those assets (often in a network-disabled sandbox) into separate phases.
