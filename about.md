Notion is a **Node.js toolchain manager**, making sure you always get the right version of Node, package managers like npm and Yarn, and CLI tools installed from npm.

Best of all, Notion makes tool requirements **declarative and reproducible** by using `package.json` to remember and launch the right versions of a projectâ€™s required tools, so developers and users always see their projects build and run in a consistent environment.

You can learn more about Notion at [the Notion web page](https://notionjs.com).
